# Software Based Solution To Fight Against Domestic Violence

According to statistics, 1 in 4 men and 1 in 3
women tend to experience some form of domestic violence at
some point in their lives. Domestic abuse can take a number of
forms - it can be physical, emotional, economical, psychological
or sexual. Most victims just tolerate this and have a fear to
fight against it, due to many factors like financial and societal
pressure. Our app focuses to help domestic violence victims to
fight against this issue, by providing a discussion platform to
share their problems anonymously and collect proof to
strengthen their case and also provide the required support by
connecting to counsellors & NGO’s

## Features of Application:

1. Discussion Platform: The victims of domestic violence are found to be afraid of
the consequences if they decide to leave their relationship,
either out of fear of their partner’s actions or concern over
their own ability to be independent. It can be difficult for
someone to admit that they’ve been or are being abused.
They may feel that they’ve done something wrong, that they
deserve the abuse, or that experiencing abuse is a sign of
weakness. Our discussion platform will act as a community
support where victims who have faced similar situations can
tell their story, about how they fought in this situation which
can be an inspiration and motivation for others and give
them a hope about a better future. Most of the victims may
not want to reveal their identity, so, we will give them an
option to anonymously post their story.

2. Collection of evidence
In case of domestic violence storing and reproducing the
evidence is very crucial. A user can collect and store their
evidence in audio, video or text form on our application.
Data is stored on the cloud to prevent data loss even when
the assaulter deletes the application. Data is stored safely
and can be used as evidence when required. Users can keep
journals about the situation and their feelings on timeline
basis. This will help victims to strengthen their case.

3. Multiple language support
In our study of existing technology, the most common
limitation found in the applications was the language barrier.
Most of the existing applications related to this topic are
restricted to only one language. In India, English and Hindi
are the commonly spoken languages. Our application will
support both English and Hindi language and will try to
overcome this barrier.

4. Disguising the Application:
Most of the time Assaulter tries to control what she(victim )
does, who she sees and talks to, what she reads and where
she goes. Isolation is a common type of domestic violence if
the app can be found out by the assaulter it may lead to
severe consequences. We disguise our application with a
day to day used app. At first glance it looks like a normal
application but there is a secret shortcut to enter and exit
from the actual app to disguise app.

5. E. Data Encryption
Our app will store very sensitive information such as
evidence of the assault in audio, video and text format. In
case if our app database get attacked by hackers then all this
sensitive information will get public. To prevent this we are
encrypting the data using AES-256 algorithm. AES 256 is
virtually impenetrable using brute-force. There are 10^77
possible combinations of the key to brute force. Data is
encrypted-decrypted in users' devices only even if we can't
not look at the data, we only know the metadata about the
file but what it is exactly storing is not visible to us.
To encrypt the data, for each user, key of size 256-bit is
generated randomly. To store the key, it is encrypted by a
password given by the user and this encrypted key can only
be read by the user who generated it. To read the data from
the database, users have to first decrypt the secret key using
password and then use this decrypted key to decrypt the
stored data.

6. Emergency Button.
In domestic violence, the victims may face some kind of
emergency, where the assaulter becomes too violent. In such
cases there is a need for an emergency panic button. Our
application will allow the victims to add emergency contacts
of their choice who will be contacted if the victim presses
the panic button. All the evidence collected by the victims
will be sent to the respective emergency contacts.

7. Contact and counselling with NGOs
In our study we found that 48% of the respondents had a
perception of tolerating the violence and convincing the
assaulter. Due to lack of education and social stereotypes
victims do not have the right guidance or knowledge about
how to tackle such situations. There are a lot of social
organizations that are proactive in this area. Our solution
acts as a bridge between NGOs and victims. NGOs can
conduct one-one counselling sessions and can guide the
victims and strengthen them mentally and emotionally.

8. Educational videos on self-defense training.
The aim of self defense is to prepare a person for any
situation that may bring harm to them. Victims should not
have to rely on others for helping them. The knowledge of
self defense will build confidence in the victims and help
them to protect themselves. Our application will also
include videos of motivational speakers, counsellors and
other victims who have faced and overcome such situations.
These videos will inspire the victims to raise their voice for
their rights.

Our application will allow the user to track their timeline
and their emotions about the abuse they face, and reproduce
it as evidence when required, provide community support
and try to overcome the language barrier. The Future work
includes collaborating with NGOs, teaching women how to
use our application. We can also improve the application by
hosting charity events and one-to-one counselling sessions
with therapists. Therefore, the application will, hopefully,
aid individuals in deciding to leave their abusive situations
and seek help.
